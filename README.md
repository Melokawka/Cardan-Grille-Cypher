# Cardan-Grille-Cypher
The project implements the cardan-grille cypher and proceeds to attack the generated encrypted text in order to determine the initial key (nothing is known except for the cypher type, and the grille size). Both polish and spanish texts were tested. The attack has 90% success rate for texts with length of 3k characters and grille size 14.
